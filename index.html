        A German cryonics start-up is offering a chance at a second life for the
        cost of a sports car. Is cryogenics within reach, or still an empty
        promise?

        The ambulance parked up by a green in central Berlin is small, almost
        toy-like; a thick orange stripe across its sides, a tangle of wires
        looping from the ceiling. </p>

        <p>It is one of three retrofitted and operated by
            <a href="https://www.tomorrow.bio/">Tomorrow.Bio</a>, Europe's first cryonics lab, whose mission is to freeze
            patients after death, and one day bring them back to life, all for a
            cost of $200,000 (£165,000).</p>

            <p>At the perfusion pump is Emil Kendziorra,
                Tomorrow.Bio's co-founder and a former cancer researcher who switched
                careers after finding progress in curing the disease "way too slow".
                While the world's first cryonics lab opened in Michigan <a href="https://cryonics.org/">almost half a
                    century ago</a>  – triggering an enduring split between those who believe it
                is the future of humanity, and others who dismiss it as a non-starter –
                Kendziorra says that appetite is building.</p>

                <p>So far they have frozen (or
                    cryopreserved) "three or four" people and five pets, with almost 700
                    more signed up. During 2025 they will expand their operations to cover
                    the whole of the US.</p>

                    <p> No one has ever been successfully revived following
                        cryopreservation, and, even if they were, the potential result could be
                        coming back to life severely brain damaged. That there is currently no
                        proof that organisms with brain structures as complex as humans' can
                        successfully be restored exposes the concept as "preposterous", says
                        Clive Coen, professor of neuroscience at King's College London. He sees
                        pronouncements that nanotechnology (carrying out elements of the process
                        on a nano scale) or connectomics (mapping the brain's neurons) will
                        bridge the current gap between theoretical biology and reality as
                        overpromises, too.</p>

        Such criticisms have not blunted Tomorrow.Bio's ambitions. Once a
        patient has signed up with the firm and a doctor confirms they are
        within the final days of their life, the company dispatches an ambulance
        to their location. When legally pronounced dead, the patient is moved to
        Tomorrow.Bio's ambulance, where the cryonics procedure begins. The
        start-up has been motivated by patients whose hearts have stopped in
        freezing temperatures and then later been restarted again. One example
        was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00b79zq">Anna Bagenholm</a> , who in 1999 spent two hours clinically dead during a
        ski holiday in Norway, but was later revived.

        bodies are cooled down to sub-zero temperatures, and supplied with
        cryoprotective fluid.

            "Once you go under zero degrees, you don't want to
            freeze the body, you want to cryopreserve it. Otherwise, you would have
            ice crystals everywhere, and the tissue would get destroyed," says
            Kendziorra, whose firm works both in practical and research areas ofcryonics.
